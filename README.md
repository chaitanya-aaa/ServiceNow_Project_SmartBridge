# 🔐 Importing & Securing Data in ServiceNow

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete process of **creating custom tables, importing external data, mapping fields, implementing dot-walking, and securing records using ACLs and Roles in ServiceNow**.

The primary objective of this project is to link each record to an employee and dynamically fetch employee details (such as department) for better reporting and structured data management.

This guided project highlights real-world ServiceNow administration concepts including **Data Import, Reference Fields, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and Role-based Security Implementation**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

To link each record to an employee and pull related employee details (like department) into the record for easier reporting and secure access control using roles and ACLs.

## 🛠️ Project Modules Covered

### 1️⃣ Creating Custom Tables
- Created a new custom table in ServiceNow.
- Defined required fields including reference fields.
- Configured table properties.

### 2️⃣ Importing Data
- Uploaded external dataset (Excel/CSV).
- Created Data Source.
- Loaded data into Import Set table.

### 3️⃣ Transform Map & Field Mapping
- Created Transform Map.
- Mapped source fields to target table fields.
- Configured coalesce and reference field mapping.

### 4️⃣ Dot-Walking Implementation
- Used dot-walking to fetch employee department details.
- Example: `employee.department`
- Enabled reporting without duplicating data.

### 5️⃣ Access Control List (ACL)
- Created ACL rules for:
  - Table-level security
  - Field-level security
- Defined read/write permissions.

### 6️⃣ Role Management
- Created custom role.
- Assigned role to users.
- Tested role-based access restrictions.
- Updated role with elevated privileges.

### 7️⃣ Testing & Validation
- Verified access restrictions.
- Tested role-based visibility.
- Validated secure data access.
